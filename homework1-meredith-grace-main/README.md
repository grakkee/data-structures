# Homework 1

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.	Familiarize students with **linked lists**
2.  Familiarize students with the Visual Studio Code **IDE** and **debugging**.

## Program
In addition to the required program files, you submission should include a makefile. 

Using C++ object oriented programming methods, create a linked list.

- You are asked to build a linked list.  
- The program should also provide a menu of choices that the user can use to do basic operations on the linked list such as a) adding a new item, b) delete an item, c) show the number of items, d) show all items, or simply to exit.  

## Submission details
To submit your project, you will have to use git on your VirtualBox installation:
1.	After accepting the assignment invitation, copy the clone URL
2.	Type 
```git clone clone URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands: 
```
git add .
git commit -m “your commit message”
git push
```
## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.


Using C++ object oriented programming methods, create a singly linked list.

The singly linked list is a chain of its item.
Each item contains two parts—data and pointer.
The data part is to store information and the pointer part of an item is used to point or to store the address of the next item.
You are asked to build a singly linked list that has two pointers—one(pfirst) points to the first item of the list and another one(plast) points to the last item of the list.
The program should also provide a menu of choices that the user can use to do basic operations on the linked list such as a) adding a new item, b) delete an item, c) show the number of items, d) show all items, or simply to exit.
